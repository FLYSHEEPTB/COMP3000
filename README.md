# AI Keep (AK) – Intelligent Fitness & Mood-Aware Exercise Recommender

**AI Keep (AK)** is a smart exercise recommendation system designed to help users improve both physical and mental well-being. It uses rule-based logic (with potential for ML/NLP integration) to suggest exercises tailored to a user’s current emotional and physical state.

## 🌟 Features

- 🧠 Emotion + Physical condition input
- 🤖 Rule-based expert system for matching suggestions
- 🧘 Recommendations for both intense and gentle activities
- 📱 Lightweight design, ready for Android integration
- 🧩 Expandable architecture for future AI/NLP model support

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User Input:**  
   The user types how they feel emotionally and physically (e.g., “I’m anxious and tired”).

2. **State Classification:**  
   The system parses the input and classifies it into predefined emotional and physical categories.

3. **Exercise Matching:**  
   Based on classification, AK matches the input with suitable physical activities from a curated suggestion library.

4. **Recommendation Output:**  
   The user receives an exercise recommendation that aims to balance their emotional and physical needs.

## 🧪 Example

**Input:**  
> "I'm feeling low and mentally exhausted."

**Output Recommendation:**  
> "Try gentle yoga or deep breathing exercises to calm your mind and body."
